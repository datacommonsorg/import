# Error Counters
Issues found in the input files are categorized under "counters". Counters
aggregate the issues, and provide a high-level overview of what went wrong.

This page is auto-generated from `error_counters.json` to provide an 
overview of all error counters and suggested actions to remedy the issues.

Error counters with **Is Prefix?: Yes** are generated with a suffix that gives
some details on the subject of the error. For example,
`Resolution_UnresolvedExternalId_` will be appended with the ID that is not 
resolved in the reports generated by `dc-import`.
